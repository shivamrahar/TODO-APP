# TODO-APP
The TodoTask app is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) technology stack. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing and organizing tasks or to-do items.

The app allows users to create an account and log in to access their personalized task list. Once logged in, users can add new tasks, edit existing tasks, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in a MongoDB database, providing data persistence and reliability.

The frontend of the app is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React components are used to create a dynamic and responsive user interface, enabling users to interact with their tasks seamlessly. The app utilizes React state management and form handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

On the backend, the app uses Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and server-side logic. Express.js provides a robust and scalable backend framework, allowing for efficient routing, authentication, and validation of user inputs. User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure access to user-specific data.

The MERN stack architecture enables a seamless flow of data between the frontend and backend, providing a fast and efficient user experience. The app leverages modern web development practices and technologies, making it scalable and easily maintainable.

Overall, the TodoTask app built using MERN technology provides users with a powerful and user-friendly task management solution, empowering them to stay organized and productiv
